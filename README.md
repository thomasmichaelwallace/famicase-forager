## About

FORAGER was made as part of the [A Game By Its Cover 2020](https://itch.io/jam/a-game-by-its-cover-2020) jam, based on the 2020 entries for the [My Famicase Exhibition](http://famicase.com/20/index.html).

The entry that I chose was [FORAGER - by Austin Breed](http://famicase.com/20/softs/062.html). Except for creating the original cartridge image, however, Austin did not commission and wasn't involved with the creation of this game. Although I hope they do enjoy it, if they ever play it!
